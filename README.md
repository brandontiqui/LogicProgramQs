## Logic puzzles
#### The horses problem
There are 25 horses and your goal is to find the fastest 3 horses. You can race horses 5 at a time and compare their speeds relative to each other. How many races are needed to figure out the fastest 3 horses?

#### The 12 ball problem
There are 12 balls. All the balls appear identical to each other, but one of them has a different weight. How many weighings with a balance scale is needed to figure out which ball is the counterfeit AND determine if it's heavier or lighter than the other 11 balls?

#### The bucket problem
You have a 13 gallon bucket, an 18 gallon bucket, and an endless supply of water. You need to measure out exactly 1 gallon of water, using only these tools. How?

#### The locker problem
There are 100 lockers and 100 students. When a student visits a locker he will open it if it's closed, or he will close it if it's open. All lockers are initially closed. Student 1 visits every locker (so he will open them all). Student 2 visits every other locker (so he will close the 2nd, 4th, 6th...). Student 3 visits every third locker (so he will change the state of the 3rd, 6th, 9th...). This continues until all 100 students have had a turn with the lockers. Which lockers are still open? Can you write an algorithm to figure it out? In constant space?
